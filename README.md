# SeaBattle!!!
Welcome to SeaBattle!!! This was the third project in Computer Programming I (C++). This game was written to be multiplayer with two instances running on two separate machines. This game was heavely inspired by the popular game "Battleship". Despite it completely being in a command line environment, it still provides the full experience including the hit, miss, and sink system. 

##Instructions
This is a two player game to make sure to open two instances on two machines. The first player will enter 1 and the second player will enter 1 when prompted. The person who goes first will be up to the players, However; it needs match on both machines. The following screenshots show the view of both player one(top) and player two(bottom)

Once initiated, the game will print two grids for each player. The primary grid is 9 ships of set sizes in a random assorment. The tracking grid is used to keep track of where you have attempted to hit. it will automatically be filled with "X" and "/" for hit and miss. Keep in mind that this very dependent on verbal communication between the two players.

After a few turns, your tracking grid should start to resemble your opponents primary grid. This will give you a general idea of where to attack next.
