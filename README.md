## SeaBattle!!!
Welcome to SeaBattle!!! This was the third project in Computer Programming I (C++). This game was written to be multiplayer with two instances running on two separate machines. This game was heavely inspired by the popular game "Battleship". Despite it completely being in a command line environment, it still provides the full experience including the hit, miss, and sink system.
