# SeaBattle!!!
Welcome to SeaBattle!!! This was the third project in Computer Programming I (C++). This game was written to be multiplayer with two instances running on two separate machines. This game was heavely inspired by the popular game "Battleship". Despite it completely being in a command line environment, it still provides the full experience including the hit, miss, and sink system. 

##Instructions

Once initiated, the game will print two grids for each player. The primary grid is 9 ships of set sizes in a random assorment. The tracking grid is used to keep track of where you have attempted to hit. it will automatically be filled with "X", and "/" for hit and miss. Keep in mind that this very dependent on verbal communication between the two players.
